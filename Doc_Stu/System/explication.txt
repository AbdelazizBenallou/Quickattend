1-  Authentication:

we have table of users , login_history , refresh_token    
Authentication allows a user to log in using their credentials stored in the Users table.
Each successful login creates a record in Login_History and a session entry in Refresh_Tokens.

Each record in Login_History and Refresh_Tokens includes a user_id foreign key that links it to the Users table.
One user can have many login history and session records, but each record belongs to exactly one user

 2. Authorization: 

 We have tables : users , role , user_role , permission , permission , role_permission 

 A user is linked to roles through User_Role, and roles are linked to permissions through Role_Permission.
Example: User Ahmed → Role: Teacher → Permissions: create_class, edit_class.

A user can have many roles, each role can have many permissions, and each permission can belong to many roles.
This lets one user inherit all permissions from their assigned roles.


3. User - Workshop : 

Each user is assigned to exactly one workshop as a leader through a foreign key linking the user to a workshop.
A workshop can be managed by many leader users, but a leader user belongs to only one workshop.

Students and workshops have a many-to-many relationship: 
a student can register in many workshops, and a workshop can contain many students through a junction table (User_Workshop).

4. Workshop - Class: 
Each class belongs to exactly one workshop and is created by the workshop’s leader.
A workshop can contain many classes, forming a one-to-many relationship between workshop and class.


5. Class - user_class - Users:

Classes and students have a many-to-many relationship: a student can attend many classes within a workshop, and each class can contain many students.
This is implemented through a junction table (e.g., User_Class) that links users (students) to classes.


6. Class - Proprities :

Each class has exactly one properties record, and each properties record belongs to one class.
This forms a one-to-one relationship between Class and Properties.

7. User - Profile :

Each user has exactly one profile, and each profile belongs to one user.
This creates a one-to-one relationship between Users and Profile.

8. Degree - Level: 

Many levels belong to one degree, and a degree can contain many levels.
This is a one-to-many relationship between Degree and Level.

Example: Degree = 1:Master ; 2:Licence , Level = 1:L1 , 1:L2 , 1:L3 , 2:M1 , 2:M2

9. Level - Specializations:

Levels and specializations have a many-to-many relationship.
A level can include many specializations, and a specialization can appear in multiple levels.

10. Profile - Specialization - Level :

Each student profile is assigned to one level and one specialization.
A specialization within a level can have many students linked to it.
