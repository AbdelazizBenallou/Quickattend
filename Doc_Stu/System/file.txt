--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have Users (Students and Leaders).

Each Leader manages exactly one workshop, and each workshop is managed by one leader.
 This is a one-to-one relationship between leader and workshop.

Students can register in many workshops, and each workshop can have many students. 
This registration is stored in a separate table.

A workshop contains many classes, and each class belongs to one workshop.
 Only the leader of that workshop can create classes.

When a leader creates a class, the system automatically creates attendance records
 for all students registered in that workshop. By default, all students are marked absent.

During the class, the leader updates the attendance and marks present students.
 Attendance is stored per student and per class.

This system allows tracking student participation and generating attendance 
reports.

1 The Workshop have one Leader ?  ore many leader ?
