we use monolithic architecture in this project
also we use REST/HTTP to define services 
we use MVC pattern to organize project  => View  -> Controler  -> Service  -> models
for the service build with 3-Tier arch 
all apis used are synchrone comm 

---------------------------------------------------
we use also docker for containerization systems
used postgres for db  postgres:17
node js 22.22.1 lts version (express)
for authentication system we used (jwt)
referse proxy nginx 
system cache used redis

need monitoring system + good security 
(DDOS, Sqli, CORS, XSS, http , authenticatio-bypass , authorization )
